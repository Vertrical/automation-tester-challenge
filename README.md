# Systems Quality Assurance Challenge

This challenge aims to evaluate your ability to analyze test scenarios and automate them. As this is a challenge for all levels, don’t feel constrained to submit the complete solution, send what you can do along with your considerations. The challenges should be grouped into a single project.

# Challenge

The challenge consists of:

1.  Specify test scenarios based on a prototype;
2.  Automate the front-end test of 2 functionalities;
3.  Automate the back-end test of an API;

## 1 - Test Scenarios

Create test scenarios based on the prototype below. You are free to use any format you want.

## 2 - Automation of front-end functionalities

On the website below, there are two functionalities to be tested.

In the first one, it is possible to render a hidden element. Create an automation that clicks on the “Start” button, waits for the element to load, and validates that the text “Hello World!” was presented. https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/1

In the second one, the selectors of the elements you use will be evaluated. Your challenge is to find good selectors for the elements. Create an automation that clicks on the three buttons presented on the screen and on all “edit” and “delete” in the grid. https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/challenging_dom

-   The scenarios and validations of automations;
-   The use of design patterns;
-   The project structure;
-   Good programming practices;

# The presentation of the challenge

-   Create a repository for the project in your personal GitHub account;
-   Create a README.md with instructions for running the project;
-   Send us the repository link via the e-mail where you received these instructions

**Good luck!**
